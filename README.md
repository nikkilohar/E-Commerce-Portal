# E-Commerce Portal
**Welcome to my E-commerce Portal project**, an online shopping system that allows users to browse, add products to their cart, and make purchases easily and securely. This platform simplifies buying and selling by connecting customers and administrators through a smooth, responsive interface.

I developed this project as part of my MCA final-year submission. It was created during my certification program at **VEXON PVT. LTD., Nashik** to demonstrate practical skills in full-stack web development.
